# By default, pagers (e.g., more, less) uses one less line than the terminal
# height. However, when PS1 spans two lines, once you quit the pager, the first
# line will be 'scrolled-up', and it takes some action to scroll-up just to
# re-read that first line (e.g., with git lol, this refers to the more recent
# commit). 
#
# This setting makes pagers to use two less line than the terminal height, by
# "faking" terminal height to -1 line.
